**Bash Scripting Learning Repository**

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts I have created while learning the basics of Bash scripting. These scripts are meant to serve as a reference for myself and others who are interested in learning Bash scripting.

## Getting Started
To run these scripts on your local machine, you will need to have Bash installed. You can download Bash for your operating system from the official website: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/.

Once you have installed Bash, you can run any of the scripts by navigating to the repository directory in the terminal and executing the script using the `./` command, followed by the script name. For example, to run script.sh, you would type the following command:

```bash
./script1.sh
```
